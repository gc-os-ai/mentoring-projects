We propose the following lines of work which we believe would represent a significant improvement in the quality of the library while being feasible within a focused period of work (~3 months).

# 1. Implement a modern p-value computation. 
The library is in need of more reliable p-values. We receive many citations from academics in social and earth sciences, and from reading their work it is clear that hypothesis testing is important to them. The current calculation in pyGAM uses an outdated approximation from Wood 2006 that is known to reject the null hypothesis too eagerly. Luckily Wood 2014 contains improved p-value calculations which are the standard in MGCV.

# 2. Scikit-Learn Interface. 
We seek to integrate pyGAM smoothly into the python ML ecosystem. However, our library has become out of sync with the modernisations in sklearn. We propose to improve pyGAM's base models and model methods (fit, predict) by allowing them to work smoothly as sklearn estimators.

# 3. Centered Feature Functions.
pyGAM is currently missing a key area of statistical rigor, which is to reduce model identifiability issues by enforcing that all spline-based feature functions sum to unity over the data distribution. This should improve numerical stability during estimation by avoiding colinearity of the intercept with multiple feature functions.
